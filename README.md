**Intro:**

Astromaders is an endless space invaders-type game. The user plays the role of a spaceship on a mission to save the planet from invading aliens/creatures.

**Menu:**

1. Play
- Starts the game.
2. Help
- Pressing this option leads to the screen explaining all of the game's rules and controls.
3. Exit
- Quits the game.

**Gameplay:**

As mentioned above, the user controls a spaceship that can simply move and launch rockets, trying to demolish the never-ending wave of dangerous creatures. The game's difficulty increases progressively as 
the enemies soon start moving quicker and also firing their own weapons more frequently. The game ends once the player gets shot or if the player collides with any of the enemies.
